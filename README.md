# SI206 Discussion 5 Fall 2023 

1) Clone that repo to your local machine with git clone <url> 

2) Open your file (or the whole folder) in VSCode and complete the assignment per the instructions. 

3) As you work, run git add file and git commit -m "message" to commit/save your changes locally. Please commit at least 4 times while working on your project; you might commit each time you finish writing a new a function or method. 

4) As you're ready, run git push to upload your saved changes to Github.  If you are prompted for a username - use your github username.  If you are prompted for a password - use your github token.

5) Submit a link to your repo to the Canvas assignment.

Use git status often to track your work. 

If something really isn't working and you've tried to get help, don't panic -- you can get the files from Canvas under Files > Discussion > Discussion 5 and then manually upload them to Github. This option will not always be available, so come to office hours or ask your GSI and we can help you figure out Git/Github.
